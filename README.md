This project is part of an ongoing research initiative on Breast Cancer Diagnosis leveraging machine learning and data-driven approaches. The study focuses on building a robust and interpretable diagnostic framework using probabilistic ensemble learning techniques to improve classification performance on clinical datasets. The framework combines multiple base learners and probabilistic aggregation strategies to capture complex patterns in patient data, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. The approach addresses challenges such as class imbalance, noisy features, and heterogeneity in clinical attributes, which are common in real-world diagnostic datasets.
